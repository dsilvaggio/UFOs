# UFOs
## Overview
  A website was created using JavaScript and HTML to display information on different UFO sightings throughout the US. Filters were added so that the data table can be sifted through based on multiple different criteria. The filters added were the date, city, state, country, and shape.   
## Results
### Build the table
  The first function written in our Javascript code builds our original table when the page is loaded. Any existing data or filters are cleared out and a for loop was used to loop through all of our ufo data and append a row and cells for each value into our table. Another for loop was then used to add each value into our table. This function allows use to see a full table of data anytime our site is loaded, as well as resets our table of any filters anytime the page is refreshed. An image of the website when loaded can be seen below:
